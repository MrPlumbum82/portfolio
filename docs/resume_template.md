To Whom It May Concern,

I am excited to apply to the Full Stack Javascript Developer position at Erndo, which I saw advertised on craigslist. My background as a Web Developer, along with my education in Computer Science, have allowed me to attain a strong foundation of technical skills. In addition to my Web Development skills, I also possess a passion for supporting local, homegrown businesses. I am confident I will be an excellent addition to your organisation.

I have managed to muster up a wide range of technical skills over the past year and a half. I am highly skilled in both client and server side Javascript and have also worked in powerful PHP frameworks such as CodeIgniter. I have always managed to delivery quality code in a short period of time and in the past six months have grown an uncontrollable urge to write test driven code. Test driven development has become my core programming philosophy. I also have experience with DevOps technologies such as dockers and very recently worked on engineering an efficient and productive continuous integration pipeline for my company. I actively seek out new technologies to learn and try to find new techniques to help me improve my skills as a developer.

For the past year I have been working overseas in Pakistan at a startup company called Programmers Force. I am planning to come back to the States in September of 2017, however I am willing and eager to provide my services as soon as Erndo decides I am right for the job.

To help you make a decision on my application I have linked my Resume and personal website at the bottom of this message. I would love to be given to chance to discuss the opportunity with you further. If you have any questions about my background, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at sadanmallhi@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,

Sadan Mallhi
